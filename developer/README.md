# Developer Demo (Prep)
* Create a Docker image called `hello` that builds from python:3.9-buster and automatically executes src/run.py
* Make sure you're able to run the container and have it yield the following output
```bash
Hello William
```
* Be prepared to answer questions regarding the demo

Note, I didn't get a chance to test the Python script so you may need to debug it before it works completely.
